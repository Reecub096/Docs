By default, all employees in an organization will be assigned with a medical insurance scheme based on the salary range and designation of the employee. Refer the following table to find the eligible insurance scheme specific to an employee.

<5000              | Clerk            | no scheme

Add employee details to HashMap.
Accept insurance scheme from user and display employee details based on Insurance scheme.
